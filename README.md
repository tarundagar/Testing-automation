# Testing-automation

A collection of well-implemented algorithms in Python for educational and testing purposes.

## Algorithms Included

This repository contains 13 Python algorithm implementations organized in the `algorithms/` directory:

### Sorting Algorithms
- **bubble_sort.py** - Bubble Sort implementation with optimization
- **quick_sort.py** - Quick Sort with both functional and in-place implementations
- **merge_sort.py** - Merge Sort with divide-and-conquer approach

### Searching Algorithms
- **binary_search.py** - Binary Search with both iterative and recursive implementations
- **linear_search.py** - Linear Search with support for finding all occurrences

### Graph Algorithms
- **bfs.py** - Breadth-First Search with path finding
- **dfs.py** - Depth-First Search with cycle detection
- **dijkstra.py** - Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm

### Dynamic Programming
- **fibonacci.py** - Multiple Fibonacci implementations (recursive, memoization, DP, optimized)
- **knapsack.py** - 0/1 Knapsack problem with backtracking

### Mathematical Algorithms
- **prime_numbers.py** - Prime number operations (checking, sieve, factorization)
- **gcd.py** - GCD and LCM algorithms with extended Euclidean algorithm
- **matrix_operations.py** - Matrix operations (multiplication, transpose, addition, etc.)

## Running the Algorithms

Each algorithm file can be run independently to see example usage:

```bash
python3 algorithms/bubble_sort.py
python3 algorithms/fibonacci.py
python3 algorithms/dijkstra.py
# ... and so on
```
